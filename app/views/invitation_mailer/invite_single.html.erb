<p>Dear %recipient.name%,</p>
<p>
Mel and Al here. We would like to formally invite you to our wedding on July 30th in Davenport, IA! We have created our own special website for our event where you will be able to RSVP, find information about the ceremony, reception and hotels, as well as look at some fun pictures of our little family. <a href="http://marzenilsemanwedding.com">Check it out Here.</a>
</p>

<p>
We will be sending out an email for <strong>each individual person</strong>, so no need to RSVP for your significant other. Hope to see you there!
</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Mel &amp; Al</p>
